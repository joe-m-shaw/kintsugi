kintsugi is a package to assist with auditing of data from genetic
testing at the North West Genomic Laboratory Hub in Manchester. Genetic
test information is split between two different databases (DNA Database
and iGene) and is also saved in individual .xlsx and .csv files.

## Installation

You can install the development version of kintsugi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("joe-m-shaw/kintsugi")
```

## What does kintsugi mean?

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery, literally
meaning “golden joinery”. The philosophy of kintsugi posits that
breaking and rejoining are “part of the history of an object, rather
than something to disguise”
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)). This project aims
to join data from multiple aspects of genetic testing, without trying to
disguise this.
